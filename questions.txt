1.  stdint.h is header file that allows the definition of 
    custom integer types. These integers can be defined to be signed 
    or unsigned, the width of these integers can de defined, and much more.

2.  The use of these datatypes ensures that specific integers
    remain unsigned/signed and thier width remains constant.

3.  BYTE - 1 byte, DWORD - 4 bytes, LONG - 4 bytes, WORD - 2 bytes.

4.  The first two bytes must be BM.

5.  bfsize is the total size of the bitmap file whereas,
    bisize is the size of the structure BITMAPINFOHEADER.

6.  if it is negative,it means that the pixels are stored
    in a top-down manner starting at upper-left corner.
    (the first pixel in file is the upperleft corner one)

7.  biBitCount specifies the color depth of a bitmap image

8.  In line 24 fopen may return NULL if the file does not exist as it open in read mode.
    In line 32 fopen may return NULL if file could not be created due to an memory error.

9.  It is one always because we need to read only one block of the required size always.

10. Padding is assigned the value 3

11. fseek is used move the file pointer to a location specified by the user.

12. SEEK_CUR tell fseek to move the pointer relative to the current position.
